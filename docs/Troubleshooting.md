# Troubleshooting

Please, read through this guide and search the [HA forum thread](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/compact-custom-header) and [Github issues](https://github.com/maykar/compact-custom-header/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) (open and closed) for your issue before posting to the forums or submitting an issue on Github.

Be sure to read through the ["Important Notes"](https://maykar.github.io/compact-custom-header/#important-notes) section of the Wiki and ["Breaking Changes"](https://maykar.github.io/compact-custom-header/#breaking-changes) section for important changes you may have missed.

[@thomasloven's lovelace guide](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-config/wiki/Lovelace-Plugins) is a great resource for installation of custom cards and solutions to common problems.

This card may not work on some older/unsupported browsers. User @pjv maintains a version of CCH for those cases, found here: [Lovelace Compact Custom Header for old devices](https://gist.github.com/pjv/521073b982e37418339afbf420691310). **I do not offer support for this method**.

**Many issues are solved by clearing your cache and refreshing the page.**

**Disable CCH to see if your issue still exists without it.**

When posting issues here or on the forums always include:
* The browser you are using
* Home Assistant version
* The config & resources section of your Lovelace code for this card
* Any errors in the HA logs and in your browserâ€™s Dev-Tools (F12) pertaining to this card
